<h1 class="MsoTitle style10">Facilities maintenance</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal style1">Version: 31 August 2011 (added details about gutter cleaning)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal style10 style16">The Delta buildings are located in an unsewered country township and so wastewater generated<font face="Arial,Helvetica"> in the business is treated on-site via a septic tank. The facilities are managed to minimise water and energy use, with a greywater recycling system and energy saving globes. As equipment is replaced, water and energy efficiency are assessed as part of the purchase decision. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal style10 style16"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <strong>septic system</strong> is a large one in comparison to the site population and is maintained by pumping out every 3-5 years. In order to minimise the frequency of maintenance and to prevent blockages, bad smells and other breakdowns, the following advice is provided:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="MsoNormal style10 style16">Do not flush anything that is not marked as suitable for septic tanks down the toilet. The toilet paper provided is appropriate, and some specific disposable items from the care room are marked as suitable for flushing into a septic tank. ALL other disposable care or personal items shall be wrapped and placed in the bins provided in the bathroom.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="MsoNormal style10 style16">When cleaning the toilet avoid the use of bleach. Water and a brush are all that is usually needed, or in stubborn cases some eco-safe dishwashing liquid. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="MsoNormal style10 style16">In the event of the septic tank working poorly and producing noxious odours, the addition of septic tank starter granules (stored under the bathroom sink) may assist speed the tank's recovery.</font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal style10 style16">The <strong>greywater</strong> system is a series of bypass valves on drains leading from individual sinks in the buildings. Attached to the bypass valves are hoses that reach the gardens and  connect to 'spreader hoses' that spread the greywater discharge over the receiving garden beds. Greywater is not held in tanks. The valves may be opened and shut to dislodge any material that builds up in the pipes, and the hoses may be disconnected to be cleaned out. The need for such interventions is reduced if the following advice is followed:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="style17">In the laboratory, diligently observe the directions posted above the sink as to what is appropriate to dispose down the drain. </li>
  <li class="style17">Ensure you <strong>never</strong> try to wash particulate matter down the drains. The use of sink strainers is advised if you are washing something that may produce solid materials, for example washing mud from waders or from the surface of digging implements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal style16 style10">Use only eco-safe laundry detergent in the <strong>washing machine</strong>. No matter which wash cycle you choose, select &quot;cold wash&quot; to save on hot water use. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal style16 style10"><strong>Hot water</strong> is produced using a solar HWS with instantaneous gas boosting for periods of grey weather. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal style16 style10"><strong>Temperature</strong> and<strong> light </strong>regulation: Windows are washed regularly to keep internal light levels high. St Kilda has a moderate maritime climate. Cool temperatures inside during summer are generally maintained by use of  blinds, external shading and cross breezes, although evaporative air conditioning is available during extreme weather in the main building and reverse cycle air conditioning is available in the laboratory and office. Similarly, winter daytime temperatures are maintained by opening blinds to allow solar gain. Very efficient gas heating is available for cold mornings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal style16 style10">An 1.5 kW embedded photovoltaic generation system (solar panels) provides much of the <strong>energy</strong> used by the business during business hours. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal style16 style10">The <strong>water supply </strong>to the facility is an automatically switched mains/rain system. When the rainwater tanks empty or when power fails, the system reverts to the mains water supply. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal style16 style10">To ensure the best quality of rainwater, gutters are cleaned annually  and all first flush devices and tank strainers should be regularly maintained. Prior to gutters being cleaned, the first flush diverter on the drinking water tank shall be opened so that any gutter washings do not enter the tank. The main storage tanks shall have the strap that holds the gutter downpipe onto the tank inlet sieve unscrewed so that the downpipe can be moved way from the tank inlet, for the same reason. </p>
