<h1 class="MsoTitle style10">Use of Care Room</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal style1">Issued: 23 February 2008 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal style1">Revised: 13 February 2011 (list of facilities altered) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> The 'care room' is a room set aside for staff with family responsibilities. It also provides a place for staff who are feeling unwell to rest. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The room is furnished with the following items: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15">bed, </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15">cupboards/bookshelf, and </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15">a small range of childcare and health consumables. </font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the interests of childrens' and family members' safety, it is a Delta policy that staff are responsible for the care for their own children or other family members who may accompany them to work, even when another staff member is assisting with that care. Delta does not provide a registered child care centre. In South Australia, people providing care for children not members of their family are required to have police clearance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal style1 style10 style15"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Staff caring for family may choose to bring additional toys or childcare equipment to work, however the responsibility for ensuring that these items meet child safety requirements remains the parent's. </font></p>
