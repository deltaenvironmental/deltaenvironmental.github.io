  <p class="style8" style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class="style8" style='text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;'>When land use is to be changed, fauna surveys may form part of the process of determining its end use. The following guidelines shall be adhered to when undertaking a fauna survey.</p>
  <p class="style8" style='line-height:12.0pt;'><b>TASK SAFETY REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
  <p class="style8" style='line-height:12.0pt;'>Safety boots and sun protection are mandatory. Wear appropriate clothing and bring wet weather gear.</p>
  <p class="style8" style='line-height:12.0pt;'>Ensure you can contact assistance if needed. Carry locational information (maps, GPS etc). Follow the <a href="/management/Lab_methods/Field_advice.htm">Field Advice</a> and carry appropriate equipment from the <a href="/management/Lab_methods/Field_equipment.htm">Field Equipment List</a>. Ensure drinking water is carried.</p>

Observational methods alone are useful for providing management information and for developments in urban, peri-urban or heavily impacted lands where rare fauna are less likely to be found..</td>

For organisms that are sedentary, one walk may be sufficient. For mobile organisms, determine whether new species are detected on a second walk. If they are, consider further walks. </td>

and whitefly/aphid traps, active searching for ants and soil invertebrates using leaf litter sieving

The manual provides information on the layout of traplines, numbers of specific types of traps per trapline, appropriate numbers of trap nights, OH&amp;S requirements, equipment lists, animal handling and ethics considerations. When trapping <strong>vertebrates</strong>, use the guidelines outlined in this manual. When sampling <strong>intertidal, saltmarsh or saltlake invertebrates</strong>, refer to previous studies in the Delta project files for advice on representative sampling. When sampling <strong>terrestrial invertebrates</strong>, the following advice holds: wet micropitfalls and various sticky lures should be spaced at least 9 per 100 square metres; construct a new species accumulation curve over the trapping period and cease trapping when the curve starts to flatten, or when four days have passed. </td>
