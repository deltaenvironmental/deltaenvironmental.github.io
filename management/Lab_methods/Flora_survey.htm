A summary book (<em>Australia's Native Vegetation</em>) and CDROM containing the national Major Vegetation Groups (broad floristic formations )and Major Vegetation Subgroups is located in the Delta library (581.9 GOV). A more detailed discussion of the larger structural formations can be found in the book <em>Australian Vegetation</em> (581.9 GRO). </p>
        <p><em>New South Wales Vegetation Classification &amp; Assessment</em> (Benson et al) comprises several books and a database on CDROM with the detailed NSW vegetation associations that have so far been completed.It is located in the Delta library at  581.9 BEN. This should be used in combination with <em>Ocean Shores to Desert Dunes</em> (Keith), shelved at 581.9 KEI. </p>
        <p>In South Australia, vegetation association definitions have been developed from a range of Biosurvey of SA surveys. The resulting association definitions are still being refined. The Floristics layer of Naturemaps contains all the agreed associations. This layer is available on the Delta GIS, or small areas may be reviewed online using <a href="http://www.naturemaps.sa.gov.au/">NatureMaps</a>. A distillation of the dataset (<em>SA Vegetation Associations</em>) is available in the Delta library, shelved at 581.9 DEH.</p>
        <p> Many of the associations have been derived from earlier work including Specht's <em>Vegetation of South Australia</em> (581.9 SPE), Boomsma &amp; Lewis' <em>The Native Forest &amp; Woodland Vegetation of SA</em> (582.1 BOO), the <em>Biodiversity Plan</em> series (333.9 DEH) and published <em>Biological Surveys </em>from BioSurvey of SA (eg 582.1 OPP, 582.1 ATK). Often these earlier works contain more descriptive detail and can be used in combination with the <em>SA Vegetation Associations</em>. To check whether there is a published survey of an area you are working in, check the <a href="http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/science/species/surveys.html">Biosurvey of SA</a> website. </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/960/1397/">http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/960/1397/</a> is the Biodiversity Audit site for  Western Australia.Several papers detailing the Beard and Hopkins <em>Vegetation Associations for WA</em>, along with a paper on the vegetation associations for the Northern Territory are shelved at 582.1 MIS.</p>
        <p>Neldner <em>et al</em> have produced <em>Methodology for Survey and
        Mapping of Regional Ecosystems and Vegetation Communities in Queensland</em>. It is shelved at 582.1 NEL. </p>
        <p>Other jurisdictions have similar projects underway. The amount of data that is being made available on the internet from public agenices is expanding rapidly, so it is always worthwhile to undertake a web search to determine whether there are more recent resources available.</p></td>
