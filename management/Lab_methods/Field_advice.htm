<h1 class="style1">Field advice </h1>
<p class="style2">Updated: 3 April 2014 (additional WZTM requirements) </p>
<p class="style2">When working in the field, keep the following in mind (all staff are encouraged to bring further advice to the attention of the senior consultant): </p>
<p class="style2">CARRY WATER, dress appropriately, let someone know where you are. </p>
<p class="style2">When working in areas where telephone or power lines are strung low, be aware of them and do not attempt to move tall equipment (long poles etc) under them. If equipment you are operating comes in contact with overhead electrical wires stay in the machine and call for help. Do not attempt to exit the machine as you are more likely to be safe whilst on the machine.</p>
<p class="style2">Operate machinery, including cars, according to the environmental conditions (weather, road state, presence of stock etc).</p>
<p class="style2">Stay on formed roads and tracks when working remotely. If it is absolutely necessary to leave a track, stay on short grass where obstacles are clearly visible. Catalytic converters in cars start fires &ndash; NEVER traverse long dry grass. In boggy conditions, the wheel tracks are the compacted area. You will get bogged if you leave them.</p>
<p class="style2">Driving on raised embankments carries additional risks. Drive slower. Stay in the centre of the track, remember that where an embankment is a pond wall, the side nearer the water may be SOFT.</p>
<p class="style2">Leave gates EXACTLY how you found them.</p>
<p class="style2">When working on an <strong>aerial</strong> or other <strong>E-M radiation site, </strong>obtain information from the client about how close you may work to the installation. Mark out the exclusion area (possibly with bollards) before starting work and do not stray into it.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>When working alongside a road, </strong>where there is a possiblity of you coming within 3 m of the carriageway or having to cross the road, it is a legislated DTEI requirement that at least one member of the team be a certified<em>Work Zone Traffic Manager</em> (WZTM). A plan of how the work zone will be managed must be developed for the site by the certified team member. The plan shall be selected from the <em>Field Guide: Traffic Control Devices for Workzone Traffic Management, version 7 2001</em>. This  manual is filed in the Delta library at 614 GOV.  Some of the most commonly encountered situations and their appropriate WZTM plans are provided here:<a href="../Environment_safety/Workzone%20layouts.pdf"> Workzone Traffic Management Plans</a></p>
<p class="style2">All bollards and signage shall be placed by the certified staff member, who shall also record the timing of sign placement and removal on a copy of your site plan each day. If you and your equipment and vehicle remain off the road, outside the white reflector posts, you may place a flashing light on the vehicle roof and place a &ldquo;Worker&rdquo; (symbolic) sign back along the road, on the verge only. Contain or fence the area you are working in with tape, mesh or cones so that others may see your work area and so that you do not stray outside it. Wear high-vis clothing. In the event of an accident occurring, even one where only property is damaged, the WZTM must contact the police, record the details of the accident on the daily copy of the site plan and withy a camera, if one is available. </p>
<p class="style2">When working alongside a <strong>railway</strong>, ensure you and the vehicle remain entirely off the ballast area. Place a flashing light on the vehicle roof and use the hazard lights. Obtain clearance from the regional controller. Wear high-vis clothing.</p>
<p class="style2">When working alongside a <strong>runway</strong>, both you and the vehicle must remain outside the safety gables unless you are directed to enter the runway area by the control tower. Place a flashing light on the vehicle roof. Wear high-vis clothing.</p>
<p class="style2"> When working on <strong>water</strong>, additional safety items are required - life jackets, flares, anchor and anchor rope/chain. A fire extinguisher and marine boat operators licence are required to be carried when operating motor boats. </p>
<p class="style2">Should you be bitten or stung, refer to the first aid booklet in the first aid kits to determine the appropriate treatment. No matter what bit/stung you, the following signs indicate a large allergic reaction and must be treated as an emergency - breaking out in hives (red and/or white raised patches) away from the site of the bite/sting, dizziness, difficulty breathing,  swelling anywhere that is not the bite/sting site or swelling of the face or throat region. </p>
<p class="style2">Wash your hands before eating lunch in the field. The following materials are suitable for hand washing: soap and water, dry-wash sanitising fluid, 'wet-ones' or 'wipes'.<br>
