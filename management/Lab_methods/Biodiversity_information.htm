Online Peter Waanders and other ornithologists publish many locality-specific bird lists. Local bird associations have contact details online and are often happy to share lists. Specialist ornithologists at the Universities are often willing to help. Obtain at least three site-specific lists if possible. </p></td>

      <p>The Birds Australia online Birds Atlas will generate a list for the 1-degree grid your site occurs in. This is a LARGE area (about 60km across) and so should only be used as a 'list' when no other data is available, as it will include birds found in other habitats than the one you are examining. Normally the data f rom this list is used as a single sentence in the report saying that &quot;the region is known to support X species of birds (Birds Australia, date), but  the local habitat hosts the following species...&quot; </p></td>

          <p>The table should have columns for common and scientific names, exotic status can be marked as an asterisk following the species name (not before - it messes with sorting), conservation significance (code and region) and then a coloumn for each data source or survey (an x for each species found). The codes and regions for birds are similar to those used in the flora, except that there are additional matters of conservation significance addressed by the EPBC Act, relating to treaties about conservation of wetlands for birds and ensuring the safe passage of international migratory species. These matters are recorded in the conserevation significance column as, for example, &quot;EPBC Act (migratory)&quot; </p></td>

Use the &quot;Protected Matters Tool&quot; to generate a list of species that have conservation significance that COULD occur in your area and use this to rate the birds recorded in the lists you have collected.
