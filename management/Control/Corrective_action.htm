<h1 class="style1">Corrective Action Procedure</h1>

<p class="style7">Revised: 12 June 2012 (SAI Global auditor observations) </p>
<p class="style7">Corrective action is required in the event of a
non-conformance to standards being found in methods, materials,
suppliers, the management system, or the product (our service).
Corrective Action Requests may be generated by auditors or
personnel, and shall always be generated on receipt of a customer
complaint, safety complaint or environmental complaint.The CAR system is also used to record auditor observations, in addition to non-conformances. </p>

<p class="style7">CAR's shall be maintained in the register below (shaded rows are completed):</p>

The draft review process we use should allow clients to provide feedback <strong>before</strong> the end of the project, ensuring they are satified with the deliverables, and we feel this provides a better outcome for the client than doing a questionaire-type paper survey after the project is finalised. We are approaching Peartree Marketing to discuss the institution of an occasional telephone exit survey. </td>
