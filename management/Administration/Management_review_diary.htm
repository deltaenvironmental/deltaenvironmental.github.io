The existing procedures included one instruction covering the use of the microscope, preparation of samples and recording of counts (<em>Biolab: Plankton counts</em>), 2 instructions specific to the sampling, identification and analysis of diatoms (<em>Biolab: Diatom sampling and identification </em>and<em> Desk studies: Generic diatom indices</em>), and one instruction containing a key for standard identification of morphogroups of plankton that had been developed specifically for use in solar saltfields (<em>Biolab: Plankton key for solar saltfields</em>). The two standardised approaches (diatoms and saltfield plankton) have been very useful in expediting sample handling. While there is already a general instruction for identification of any flora/fauna samples (Biolab: Identification of plants and animals) we decided that specific plankton identification sheets for general use, including one that divided the common species into morphogroups for the purpose of producing rapidly repeatable analyses, would be useful. As a result <em>Biolab: Illustration of common estuarine plankton </em>and <em>Biolab: Plankton morphogroups for general plankton counts </em> were developed.</p></td>

That said, she attended defensive driving training after the first incident in order to help her recognise unexpected actions by other drivers. As both Renae and Peri underwent WorkZone Road Safety trainingin early 2007, the necessity to be highly visible was reinforced. The works vehicle has had additional reflective strips and flashing lights added, to it to increase its visibility, making the vehicle WorkZone compliant as well as improving its visibility in general traffic situations. </td>

NATA Certication Systems International has ceased to support the administration of our quality standard (QBase). They are preparing a proposal to migrate Delta across to ISO 9000 for smaller businesses. This will require, at a minimum, an additional 'internal audit' requirement in additon to the regular external surveillance audits. </td>
