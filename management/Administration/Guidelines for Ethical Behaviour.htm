    Delta
      Environmental Consulting recognizes that it is important to
      provide our clients with an unimpeachable standard of personal
      integrity. Various research organisations have recently developed
      guidelines for workers in the research field (eg. the CRC for
      Water Quality &amp; Treatment) and these guidelines are based
      upon those. Additionally, as a member organisation of the Water
      Industry Alliance Delta is a signatory to the Code of Ethics and
      Conduct of that organisation. Delta also notes and endorses, as a
      comprehensive framework of minimum acceptable standards, the
      Joint NHMRC/AVCC Statement and Guidelines on Research Practice.

  <b>Our  Guidelines</b><br>
  We <b>respect
        the laws of the land. </b><br>
  <br>
  We conduct
    ourselves with <b>professionalism and integrity:</b> we are fair,
          honest and impartial in our dealings, and we treat others with
          dignity and respect. We give all of our colleagues the <b>care
        and courtesy </b>that we would wish to receive. <br>
  <br>
  We are
    aware of possible <b>conflicts of interest: </b>we avoid
          conflicts of interest when they are avoidable, and we declare
        conflicts of interest when they are unavoidable. <br>
  <br>
  While we work
    efficiently and endeavour to <b>further the interests </b>of our
          clients and the interests of all parties associated with them, we
          are attentive to the <b>interests of the broader community</b>.<br>
  <br>
  We are
  aware of obligations to <b>maintain confidentiality of
          information: </b>we do not use this information for personal or
          other gain.We ensure that <b>intellectual property </b>is
          properly protected during our involvement with our clients, as
          well as observing appropriate business and commercial protocols. <br>
  <br>
  We <b>exercise
          due skill, care and diligence </b>in performing our duties and
          acknowledge our responsibility to maintain currency of our
          knowledge, skills and technical competencies. <br>
  <br>
  We are <b>fair
          and honest </b>in our relationship with suppliers and purchasers
          and <b>avoid both the appearance and reality of being influenced
          by any party, or of being prejudiced or biased </b>in our
          dealings with third parties and stakeholders. </font>
