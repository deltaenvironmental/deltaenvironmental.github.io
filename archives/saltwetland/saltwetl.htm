</font></span>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.1 Ecology of saltwater wetlands</b>
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marine saltwater wetlands are known by various names worldwide. In Europe
      
they are called merselands, washes or saltings, while in the Middle East
      
salt marshes are sabkhas. In Australia they are called by the dominant
      
species present, so in South Australia the marine/freshwater marsh area
      
is referred to as “samphire,” in Queensland “marine couch meadow” and in
      
some parts of Victoria “Spartina flats.”
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Barker Inlet, saltwater wetlands occur naturally behind the mangrove
      
forests and as the artificially constructed ponds of the saltfields. The
      
naturally occurring wetlands are low lying, and show zonation that is dependent
      
on level above or below tidal influences. At their upper extreme these
      
wetlands grade into dryland coastal zone ecosystems or into freshwater
      
swamps. The latter systems, with their complex patterns of saline/fresh
      
water flows and wide variety of plant species could form a model for the
      
proposed Swan Alley Saltwater Wetlands to be constructed at the mouth of
      
the Little Para River.
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The physical characteristics of saltwater wetlands affect the distribution
      
of plants within them. Chapman (1960, p2) in Salt Marshes and Salt Deserts
      
of the World commented on the uniformity of appearance in plants of both
      
saline and alkali lake environments. She postulated that while there was
      
no doubt that the chloride ion was of great significance in the maritime
      
marshes, the sodium ion was the common factor in all the studied environments
      
(salt marsh, inland salt lakes, soda or alkali lakes) and was probably
      
responsible for the similarity in vegetation. Convergent evolution is a
      
common phenomena where plants and animals have similar morphologies in
      
response to a common stress, which in this case is undoubtedly osmotic
      
dehydration.
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saltwater wetlands occur on a variety of substrates. In Australia the
      
majority occur in delta environments on a firm muddy to clayey soil. The
      
terrestrial plant communities most common in South Australia are dominated
      
by samphires of the genera Halosarcia, Sclerostegia and Sarcocornia in
      
the tidal zones, grading to communities of Typha, Bolboschoenus, Phragmites
      
and Juncus where freshwater enters the wetland system. In Europe three
      
major soil types and their associated plant communities have been identified:
</font>
<ul class="style5">

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

muddy sand with a plant community dominated by grasses</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

soft clay or silty mud with Spartina communities</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

firm clayey soil with mixed herbaceous plants</font></li>

</ul>

<span class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saltwater wetlands that are mainly dominated by grasses have a restricted

distribution in Australia. Zones of marine grasses exist behind bands of

River Mangrove (<i>Aegiceras corniculatum</i>) and Orange Mangrove (<i>Ceriops

tagal</i>) in Queensland. The introduction of <i>Spartina</i> in Victoria

has seen that grass become a weed in wetland areas, to the extent of restricting

the growth of mangroves in the upper tidal zone.

</font></span>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aquatic plants common in the waterways of a saltwater swamp vary from
      
marine algae and seagrasses to freshwater aquatics. In areas of high salinity
      
halophilic angiosperms such as <i>Ruppia</i> and <i>Lepilaena</i> are found,
      
while blue-green algae form mats and colonies in shallow ponds and exposed
      
mud areas.
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saltwater wetlands are part of a changing environment. Sedimentation and erosion 
  
  provide the framework for a succession environment that starts with seagrass 
  
  beds in the subtidal zone, passing through the mangrove zone, salt marshlands, 
  
  freshwater reed swamps, bush colonisation to regional forest. Such environments 
  
  are termed “seral” and zones within them are not considered to be static. The 
  
  underlying geography or the activities of humans may both cause interruptions 
  
  and irregularities in the theoretically smooth transition of biotypes. Figure 
  
  1 shows the interrelationships between the abiotic and biotic factors that determine 
  
  the nature of the wetland. </font>

  </font>
</center>



<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The combination of factors in Figure 1 determines the character of the

wetland. For instance, the Adelaide climate is relatively dry during the

high sunshine months, restricting the plant communities to slow-growing

types resistant to aridity. Similarly the low rainfall, semi permeable

soil and flat profile indicates that the wetland will be hypersaline during

summer. The low wave velocity and small tidal range means extensive mud

flats.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Areas where the underlying landforms show a sudden increase in relative

height may prevent the formation of the next zone. The mangrove/samphire

interface zone is commonly mentioned as under “area pressure” in the Barker

Inlet area, but a review of the past ecosystems of the Adelaide Plains

shows that the transition zone between saltwater wetland and freshwater

wetland has been possibly more impacted (Tyler et al, 1976, p123). </font>
<p align="left" class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While regional geography and human activities result in discontinuous

succession, land subsidence and land lifting (along fault lines) or rising

sea levels have a more widespread though diffuse effect. Lifted saltwater

swamps will rapidly progress to freshwater. Where land subsides or the

sea level rises, erosion will occur at the marine edge of the group of

coastal ecosystems and plants from each zone will tend to colonise further

inland.

<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aquatic plants in the area include seagrasses and hypersaline tolerant

seagrasses such as <i>Ruppia</i> and <i>Lepilaena</i> as well as green

and red macroalgae in areas where the salinity is high. Benthic mats of

algae and bacteria crust the exposed mud surface and the floors of shallow

pools. Pelagic plankton including diatoms, chlorophytes, dinoflagellates

and filamentous blue-green bacteria are found in samphire pools as well

as in the mangrove creeks and freshwater reed swamps. Where the freshwater/saltwater

interface occurs, floating plants such as the duckweeds (<i>Lemna</i> and

<i>Wolffia</i>) and water buttons (<i>Cotula crassifolia</i>) are common.

<i>Azolla</i> is only found in the freshest areas. Submerged saltwater/freshwater

species include algae such as <i>Enteromorpha</i> and <i>Chaetomorpha</i>.

Pondweeds (eg <i>Potamogeton, Myriophyllum</i>) prefer the freshwater end

of the zones.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the proposed Swan Alley wetlands are subject to tidal influx, mangrove

accession may take place. Even without tidal movement, mangroves may establish

where water salinities approach that of seawater and there is a regular

depth of water. Plants of

    <i>Avicennia marina</i> are established in the

northernmost Penrice Dry Creek Saltfield ponds at Middle Beach in South

Australia, where there is no tidal variation but a constant supply of water

of seawater. This is not an unusual occurrence and all saltfields in Australia

that are in areas where mangroves occur have mangroves growing in their

initial ponds.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should mangrove accession be visualised in the design of the wetlands,

consideration should be given to planting out methods. Recent research

in Florida (Riley, 1996) using encapsulation to protect young propagules

while their anchor roots are establishing shows promise for revegetating

areas of high water velocity.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.1.2 fauna</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The faunal mix of a saltwater wetland depends on whether its salinity

regime is predominantly saline or freshwater. Fauna from the mangrove zone

will be found in the samphire zone, particularly at times of very high

tides, while freshwater molluscs and other invertebrates will be found

in the interface zone between the fresh and saltwater wetlands.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some invertebrates are adapted to changing salinities by virtue of short

life cycles. Brine shrimp (<i>Artemia spp</i>) are notable for this. Brine

shrimp can survive in a variety of salinities almost to the point of salt

crystallisation. They adjust to salinity changes in the first 24 hours

after hatching, and then must remain at that salinity. The presence of

cysts in the sediments and along pond edges ensures regular recruitment.

With salinity changes over time in a temporary wetlands, regular hatchings

of new nauplii are available to maintain the population.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While temporary wetlands are still fresh they support a wide array of

invertebrates and small fish. <i>Daphnia, Paracyclops</i>, predatory dragon

and damsel fly larvae, beetle larvae and water boatmen abound. As the salinity

increases the variety is reduced. Water boatmen have been observed in the

drying ponds of the Connector Wetlands at Dry Creek SA, when the salinity

increases rapidly. Once the water approaches seawater salinity it is colonised

by brine fly larvae and possibly marine invertebrates if the ecosystem

is continuous.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="1.2"></a><b>1.2 Water quality performance of saltwater wetlands</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ability of a wetland to improve the quality of the water flowing

through it is correlated to both physical and biological factors. A toxic

element entering the wetland may variously become diluted or concentrated,

chemically transformed into a more inert or more active form, may accumulate

or dissipate. Ideally, a wetland will isolate and transform the toxic or

undesirable elements entering the basin, resulting in a clean outflow.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.2.1 mechanisms for the improvement of water quality</b>

</font>
<center class="style5">

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Herricks (1991) developed the table below, which nominates how the varying

physical characteristics of a water body affect the concentration of toxic

substances. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Table 1 Physical characteristics of reservoirs and resulting
  
effects on toxics within them&nbsp;<img SRC="table.jpg" ALT="Table showing pollutant fate in water bodies" height=379 width=561></font>
</center>



<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Herricks (1991) table provides a useful check list for water bodies

such as reservoirs, however dilution is not really an option in the relatively

small wetlands envisaged unless there is a isolated point source pollutant.

The main objective of the wetlands is to remove the pollutants from the

water column. They may be stored safely in sediments or in the biomass

of the wetland. They may also, or subsequently, degrade into less toxic

forms or completely disintegrate into their component elements. Eventually

the components of many toxics entering the wetland will be recycled as

part of the biomass. Additionally, the sediment plays an important part

in the amount of and type of toxins stored in the wetland. The primary

process is the reduction oxygenation (redox) reaction which controls the

rate of toxin mobilisation and fixing.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.2.1.1 dilution</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dilution is not the solution to pollution, or at least not to all pollution.

Some pollutants need to be diluted before they can be effectively dealt

with, notably heavy loads of nutrients. The various nitrogen species in

particular may be too concentrated upon first entering a wetland and may

actually damage plants. Once diluted by the body of water within the basin

the nutrients can be safely taken up by aquatic plants.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a wetland is the only method of treatment that wastewater receives,

a sudden influx of concentrated pollutants that results in damage to the

wetland will also result in a large export of pollutants from the wetland.

This is very visible when extremely high levels of nitrogen “burn off”

the plants of the wetland, which then contribute their own biomass to the

pollutant load. In order to ensure effective functioning of the wetland

it is necessary that pollutants be “diluted” either in actuality (in the

ponds themselves) or virtually, by a reduction in the loads put into the

system in the first place. The best way to ensure that pollutants are not

in such levels as may harm the wetland is to manage the catchment feeding

it. Also, the larger the wetland is, compared to the influx of pollution,

the greater the chance that its ecosystem will be buffered from damage

by the dilution of harmful substances. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.2.1.2 degradation</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chemicals within the water column in a wetland may degrade in various

ways. Chemicals that can absorb light energy may undergo photolysis. The

molecules that absorb light energy become fragile and are accelerated towards

breakdown (Matsui, 1991). Under certain pH conditions hydrolysis may take

place, where a hydroxyl (OH) radical is incorporated into the molecules

of the chemical reducing the structural integrity of the molecule, which

subsequently breaks down.. Biological degradation includes microbial degradation

and metabolic changes within plants and animals that have taken up the

substances. All of the above processes are primarily concerned with the

degradation of organic compounds, although they sometimes apply to inorganic

compounds. Interestingly, not all breakdown products are less toxic that

their parent compound.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.2.1.3 sorption</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organic chemicals can be sorbed onto the soil or sediments in a wetland

basin, resulting in a reduction in the levels of these chemicals in the

water column. The rate of sorption depends amongst other things on the

aqueous solubility of the organic chemical. DDT and PCB’s sorb to the sediment

quite readily, while Lindane and 2,4,5-T do not (Matsui, 1991). Sorbed

chemicals are not always permanently retained in the sediments however,

and may desorb back into solution. The rate of desorption is dependent

on water depth, water turnover time and also on how much of the chemical

is being degraded microbially and photolytically. Desorption in saline

areas may be slowed by the presence of benthic “algal” mats (Coleman and

White, 1993) which partition the nutrient rich sediments away from the

overlying brines. Climatic conditions that disturb these mats may result

in a sudden influx of nutrients and metals back into the water column. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frequently when discussing metal pollution it is easier to use categories

to describe the state of the metal in the environment that refers to its

activity in the environment. For instance, the notions of “sinks” and (re)mobilisation

are commonly used in the literature for good reason. Most metals that are

of concern to humans are sparingly soluble, and therefore the metal is

concentrated in sinks. Often the processes of concern are those that move

the metal ions in and out of the sinks. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In classic sorption non-ionic bonding of metal ions to various substrates

occurs. Metals removed from the water column in this form can be rapidly

remobilised as the bonding is usually not very strong. Ferric oxide (FeO)

for instance, is strongly sorbed to clay. Lead, nickel, copper and zinc

are also sorbed to clay in decreasing order of strength.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Often metal ions precipitate in association with other metal ions (co-precipitation).

A common pair is ferrous and manganese but often cobalt, zinc and copper

are also coprecipitated with ferrous. These complexes are released back

into the water column under some anaerobic conditions (redox) commonly

found in the sediment of saltfield ponds. It is of interest from a water

quality point of view that iron is an efficient scavenger of arsenic.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Complexation and flocculation of metals occurs with organic material.

For instance, EDTA is often used in chemical procedures to bond metals.

Metals bound in such a manner can either be settled to the floor of the

ponds and recycled as the organic matter is decomposed, or taken directly

into the food chain. The metals can be made relatively inert as long as

the organic material is stable. However, metals are particularly rapidly

assimilated into the food chain when bound to organic material. In decreasing

order of strength Pb, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, Cd, Fe, Mn, Mg form associations

with humic material.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Metals will independently form inorganic precipitates, for instance

as oxides and chlorides. Generally these precipitates are relatively stable.

Cadmium forms a precipitate with carbonate in alkaline conditions. Chromium

and ferrous/ferric form insoluble hydroxides and have short residence times

in media with high oxygen levels. Lead, zinc, copper and chromium also

rapidly form hydroxides in that order. In an anaerobic environment metal

sulphide salts are stable.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remobilization of the metals most commonly occurs under the following

circumstances: redox changes, complexing with organic acids and microbial

activity. All three result in the metals moving from the sediment back

into the water column. All are the direct or indirect result of bacterial

action in nature. Ponds in saltfields and samphire areas have a very active

microbial mat in the sediment. In saltfield ponds prior to the gypsum precipitation

point these are quite often oxygenizing, but typically the sediment in&nbsp; gypsum ponds has a very strong reduction potential. Increased temperature

also plays a major part in the remobilisation of metals from the sediment. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.2.1.4 bioaccumulation</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pollutants in water may accumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms

inhabiting a wetland. Aquatic organisms take up an organic substance in

direct proportion to its aqueous concentration, while the picture for inorganic

substances such as heavy metals is not so clear, due to competitive uptake

of other ions. This accumulation may have a direct impact on the organism,

or it may have no noticeable effect on one organism but may be concentrated

up through the food chain until it impacts on another species.

</font>

(especially autotrophs and microscopic heterotrophs) by the process of

osmosis. In some situations this will occur until a point is reached where

the concentration in the organism’s tissues and the concentration in the

water are in equilibrium. In other cases the pollutant may take part in

the metabolic process in the organism, and may become concentrated or excreted

as part of that metabolic process. Where the chemical is used as a metabolite

or a substitute, the pollutant is often actively transported into the organisms

cell, resulting in very high concentration. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.2.1.4.2 trophic accumulation</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A pollutant may be incorporated into an organism through direct ingestion

either of the pollutant itself, as for example when a filter feeder ingests

fine particulates that may be carrying heavy metals, or through the ingestion

of another organism that has the pollutant already incorporated in it.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Metal ions that are ingested are often passed through the organism and

deposited as faecal material. The ions which are incorporated into a plant

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exchange of toxins between trophic levels can sometimes result in

greater concentrations in the higher trophic organism. Two classic examples

of biomagnification of a toxic substance through serial accumulation are

the outbreak of Minamata Disease in Japan as a result of mercury entering

the food chain, and Itai-Itai disease where cadmium from a smelting company

entered a river supplying water to rice paddies.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some authors, notably Odun in 1959 (Matsui, 1991) have theorised that

eutrophic systems such as shallow wetlands ensure the minimum quantities

of accumulated elements are transferred to the upper trophic levels. This

is because the biomass of the producers in such a system is much higher

than that required to support the other trophic levels and therefore much

of the accumulated toxics will be sedimented with the excess phytoplankton

and will become available to the sorption pathway. Where there is a high

efficiency of converting producer biomass into carnivore biomass, such

as in the open ocean or deep waters, a much larger quantity of the toxins

may be found in the higher trophic levels.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also the case that a eutrophic water body has a very large amount

of polarised surface area, in the form of cell walls, available to sorb

pollutants. The soluble organic matter in an eutrophic water is also very

high, facilitating further sorbtion and potential flocculation of toxins.

Blue-green bacteria produce copious amounts of soluble organics and some

of these have been found to be very efficient scavengers of nutrients and

some metals (Coleman, unpublished).

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The water quality functions of constructed freshwater wetlands are relatively

well understood. Data for saltwater wetlands has been, in the main part,

collected from naturally occurring wetlands or has been deduced by extrapolation

from marine data. Controlled saltwater environments are not common, with

the exception of saltfields.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coleman, in his paper Phosphate Mass Balance in a Constructed Saline

Wetland (to be published 1996) comments that,

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“ Limitations in researching nutrient cycling within waterbodies are

a lack of control when working with large bodies, and for smaller water

bodies the uncertainty of applying conclusions reached from small scale

experiments... there are several reasons why saltfields are a valuable

source of data... the closed pond system is monitored for physical as well

as biological characteristics... in some fields the data extends back 30

to 40 years... the system is normally maintained at a constant salinity

over many years... the saltfield system is designed and exhibits a consistency

that is not found in natural systems.”

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His research, conducted at two Queensland saltfields over eight years,

shows that the initial ponds with high species diversity removed phosphates

efficiently. As species diversity fell in the succeeding ponds, phosphates

were not removed. Next, the more hypersaline ponds rich in filter feeders

removed a “second helping” of phosphates. Any remaining phosphates were

available to cyanobacteria growing in the most saline ponds. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saline wetlands have a decided advantage in their ability to reduce

the phosphates in their discharge waters. Seawater is relatively high in

calcium which is sparingly soluble with phosphate. Under alkaline conditions

the majority of the phosphate is precipitated into the sediment.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a constructed saltwater wetland designed to treat stormwater runoff,

much of the water quality improvement will be as a result of the removal

of turbidity (by slowing down water flow) and nutrients (by uptake into

plants). Therefore the productivity of the macrophytes selected for planting

is of major importance. Mangroves and estuarine swamps are generally highly

productive. Naturally occurring wetlands in the area variously support

populations of mangroves, samphires, rushes, reeds and sedges, with some

areas of sea couch.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent research (Clarke and Jacoby, 1994) at Jervis Bay compared the

productivity of a species of sea-rush (<i>Juncus kraussii)</i> with the

productivity of other salt marsh plants. They established an annual above

ground production of 0.81 kg/m2 for the <i>J. kraussii</i> growing in Jervis

Bay in 1989. This was higher than the productivity of neighbouring stands

of <i>Avicennia marina</i> (0.31 kg/m2/yr).

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authors compared the estuary they were studying to several in Western

Australia and discovered that while standing crops of <i>Juncus

</i>at

Jervis Bay seemed similar to those at the Western Australian sites, the

standing crops of other salt marsh plants were about half of those in the

West. <i>Sarcocornia </i>was measured as having a standing crop of 317

g/m2 and <i>Sporobolus</i> (marine couch) had a standing crop of 349 g/m2.

It is likely that environmental parameters such as water flow and salinity

produced the wide variation in results. As a general rule even halophilic

plants are more productive with regular freshwater flushing.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research at Lake Biwa in Japan (Kurata and Kiro, 1991) showed that stands

of <i>Phragmites communis</i> growing around the lake utilised up to 250

kg of nitrogen per hectare every year and 25 kg of phosphorus. Typical

blooms of submerged and planktonic plants utilised nitrogen at a rate of

0.35g/cubic metre of lake water annually. Saltwater wetlands tend to be

shallower than Lake Biwa, which averages 3.5 metres deep, and so exhibit

correspondingly higher productivity.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The major ecological advantage of constructing a saltwater wetland at

the mouth of the Little Para River is that it mimics the natural system

found in the area prior to human intervention. Large discharges of freshwater

into the marine environment, even when “cleaned” by a freshwater wetland

are a shock to the mangrove and seagrass ecosystems. The ideal situation

is where a river or drainage system discharges through an estuary or coastal

swamp. This allows for gradual changes in salinity while turbidity and

nutrient loads are stripped from the water. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A saline wetland has all of the advantages of a freshwater wetland,

with some additional features. The greater diversity of environments means

greater diversity of habitats for birds and other animals. It provides

a wildlife corridor from the coastal fringe to the hinterland. Estuaries

are typically more productive, in fisheries terms, than most other marine

habitats and from a conservation point of view the construction of saltwater

wetlands means the construction of more suitable habitats for breeding.

Lastly, the chemical changes at the marine/freshwater interface provide

an unique opportunity for the precipitation of chemicals before they are

deposited into the sea.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such natural ecosystems are not static, and the location of the varying

salinity regimes does move depending on climatic factors such as droughts

or wetter than normal winters. Many of the plants and animals found in

such environments can cope with such changes, however there are occasional

events that may result in the death of stands of plants. The Orange Mangroves

(<i>Ceriops tagal)</i> of the Calliope River anabranch in Queensland have

suffered considerable dieback during the last four years of drought in

Central Queensland. The stumps of the dead trees will prevent rapid water

velocities in the area when the next wet period occurs, ensuring rapid

recruitment of new trees. The stumps form perching areas for fishing birds

such as cormorants in the meantime.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ground water in this region is typically saline, with a salinity

up to 100 parts per thousand, or two to three times seawater. Sodium ions

from the salty groundwater act upon soil mechanically, dispersing colloids

(Chapman, 1960, p2). The measurable effects include slower water movement,

poor aeration, and “physiological drought” resulting from the high rate

of water absorbtion by the soil colloids. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The salinity of the ground water is a result of wicking of marine water

through the coastal St Kilda formation. The driving force for the marine

brine movement through the formation is solar evaporation and the transpiration

of water by plants, leaving the salts behind in the soil to increase the

local salinity. The effect of St Kilda Formation ground water on the wetland

is that the wetland will gradually become more saline during the seasons

with reduced flow through the wetland. The impact of the saline groundwater

will be greater in the initial setup of the wetland, but as the fine organic

sediment forms on the base and sides of the constructed wetland the movement

of ground water into the wetland will decrease. Algae mats are very useful

in restricting movement of groundwater into water bodies.

<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.4.2.2 evaporation</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any body of water is subject to evaporation. There are several factors

that change the rate of evaporation from a waterbody. Most are to do with

meteorological conditions, but some such as water depth and colour are

specific to the water body. With all things considered, the evaporation

from the Little Para wetland should be in the region of 10 to 20 mm per

hot summer day. If the water that is being evaporated is saline, whether

from tidal inundation or ground water contamination, the salinity will

increase.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will have an effect on the formation of the long-term ecosystem.

For instance if there are marked fluctuations in salinity the ecosystem

is more likely to be dominated by cyanobacteria than the more complex plants

and algae. In some case a cyanobacterial mat may be preferential to exposed

mud, but it is generally considered that emergent foliage is better at

nutrient trapping than a mat that would contribute to the nitrogen load

of the water body by fixing nitrogen from the air.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A mass balance model would assist in determining the likely quantity

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wetland will have marked seasonal variations in flow and salinity.

The winter period will be dominated by fast freshwater flows. The volume

from a typical downpour will easily over run a small wetland and obviously

the salinity will be low for most of the winter/spring period. The salinity

will gradually increase over the summer period with minor tidal overflows

and ground water movement into the deeper sections of the wetlands. The

final salinity will depend on the combination of the effects of tidal inflow,

groundwater movement, evaporation and freshwater runoff from the catchment.

It is understood that the latter can be controlled from the wetlands further

upstream. The autumn period will be characterised by very high tidal flows

into the wetlands and it is expected that the wetlands will become predominately

marine until the winter rains come. If the winter flow is minor there may

be a problem with the salinity of the wetlands during the following summer.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The salinity needs to be monitored and adjusted as the seasons change.

It is important to manage the wetland with natural variability in mind.

Average flow regimes will be useful for design but a means of modifying

the salinity profile will be needed for the non-average year.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.4.2.4 wetland profile</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The profile of the wetland should be carefully considered as it will

affect the final biological structure of the wetland. The most appropriate

model for a saline wetland is one that occurs naturally. There are basically

two natural types of wetlands with a range between the two.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first is an estuary where the freshwater flows down a channel and

the marine waters form a saline wedge beneath the freshwater, and the saline

wedge moves back and forth with the tide. The water body is essentially

marine with short periods of freshwater during high rainfall.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second type is the delta or salt marsh where the freshwater is forced

to flow over a shallow area covered with hypersaline type plants. The area

is periodically covered with marine water during high tides, and there

is much less transportation of marine water through the wetland. This form

of wetland is much more efficient at capturing nutrients and sediments,

but does have a high salinity during low rainfall periods and may impede

the flow of freshwater during floods.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is normal to have a deeper section behind the shallow bar separating

the fresh from the seawater. This basin is designed to act as a reservoir

or buffer allowing the freshwater to have a longer retention time. This

basin will gradually become saline from the groundwater unless the freshwater

is higher than the ground water levels and the fresh is allowed to perch

through the soil. A freshwater lens will gradually develop but there must

be a constant feed of freshwater from the water course upstream of the

wetlands, otherwise the deep basin of the wetland will become another “Kellar’s

Pit” (Barker Inlet Wetlands), with a salinity stratification from top to

bottom. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.4.2.5 stratification</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Water bodies exhibit varying degrees of stratification of temperature

and density. In freshwater lakes this becomes noticeable once the depth

exceeds 5metres, however saline lakes may show marked stratification even

when they are quite shallow.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a freshwater lake the stratification reflects the ambient air temperatures.

In summer a warm, less dense layer of water forms the well aerated epilimnion,

there is a thermocline underlying it and a dense, cold, hypolimnion forms

in the deeper areas and is characterised by poor aeration. As the water

of the epilimnion cools to 4oC in autumn, it reaches the point of greatest

density and starts to fall through the lake waters to the lake floor, bringing

oxygen to the hypolimnion.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In saline wetlands the density and temperature of the water reflect

salinity levels as well as the ambient temperature, and modeling the movement

of stratifications in these systems is not uni-dimensional. Computer models

have been developed for estuaries and coastal lagoons, which provide for

detailed analysis of the systems, however the main features of saltwater

stratification are summarised below.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saline, dense water contains considerable heat, and the majority of

pools in constructed wetlands are shallow enough for this water to gain

heat from solar radiation. As a result, fresher water overlying the denser

water will exhibit a lower temperature than the deeper water. This warm,

dense, deeper water will not have the capacity to carry as much oxygen

as the deep water in a freshwater lake.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Water entering a wetland flows down along the bottom of the waterbody

until it reaches the zone of denser water. At this point the inflowing

water spreads rapidly across the horizontal plane of the waterbody. In

a waterbody characterised by shallow saline groundwater intrusion, light

freshwater inflows will spread out across the surface of the lake rather

than flowing down to the benthic zone. Depending on the height of any weir

controlling the outflow, the denser water may remain permanently in the

deeper area and the freshwater may be “skimmed” or decanted off before

the desired retention time has been achieved. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To prevent this occurrence, inflows into such systems may be through

bottom opening weirs, where the floor of the receiving pool is of a similar

depth to the bottom of the inflow channel, or through piped ports into

the deepest parts of receiving pools that are much deeper than their inflow

channels. Outflows should similarly be constructed to ensure that water

on the surface of the waterbody is retained for the desired time.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The less dense inflow water leaving a piped port will tend to form a

buoyant plume. Ambient water will become entrained in the plume as it rises

and travels away from the port. The plume will, as a result, become denser

until equilibrium with the surrounding water is reached (Metcalf &amp; Eddy, 1991 p 1227) or, in strongly stratified ponds, until it reaches a

layer of water that is less dense (ie the surface freshwater layer) in

which case it will remain just under that layer. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.4.3 pollutant removal issues</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pollution such as nutrients and metals that are removed from the water

column must be themselves be removed from the wetland. The pollution may

be bound up with organic material such as plants or inorganic salt in the

sediment. If the monitoring program determines that the pollutants are

being deposited in the sediment, the requirement of removing them is not

so urgent as it would be in the case if the pollutants are “temporarily” bound to plants. Even so, sediment will gradually accumulate and the wetland

will cease to function as one, necessitating the removal of the sediment.

Dredging is the obvious solution but a strategy must be put in place to

minimise the effort to remove the bulk of the sediment and its destination

once it has been removed. </font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The organic material is easily harvested but again the strategy is not

to remove organic material but the pollutants that they have accumulated.

Some plants accumulate metals more efficiently than others and these should

be harvested more regularly than others. On the other hand those species

should be encouraged to grow and not be unduly setback by overharvesting.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The design of the wetland should include long term planning for the

removal of sediments and plant material that is cost effective and consistent

with the better operation of the wetland as a pollutant trap.

<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.5.1.1 chemical monitoring of wetland effectiveness</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The water should be monitored as it enters and leaves the wetland, and

the sampling regime should be biased to capture an accurate picture of

the nett export into and out of the wetland.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For instance there is not much point in sampling the outflow when there

is little water movement. Most sampling should take place during peak flow

but access is often difficult during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring

on a time basis suffers the same basic problem, with the high flow rates

being under sampled per unit volume flow through the wetland. Time based

sampling has some value. However, without the data being correlated with

water flow it provides little valuable information, and becomes merely

an exercise in data collection.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At times the chemical characteristics of the wetlands will change radically.

These changes will often be of a cyclic nature, either seasonal or diurnal.

Whereas it is impractical to monitor the wetlands extensively for cycles,

some understanding of the cyclical nature of the water body is needed.

For instance, at least one 24 hour sampling regime is needed per season,

more if automatic equipment is available.

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most, if not all, of the nutrients and heavy metals will be mobilised

from the wetland sediment during the night, and in particular the early

hours of the morning. The wetland can mobilise large quantities of pollutants

during very short periods of time (less than 4 hours). However, the mobilisation

of pollutants is not the same as the export of pollutants as the chemicals

are often incorporated back into the sediment without leaving the waterbody.

<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.5.1.1.1 parameters</b>

</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following parameters should be measured on a weekly basis from the

inflow and outflow as part of the routine monitoring program:

</font>
<ul class="style5">

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

turbidity</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

reactive and total phosphate</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> total nitrogen, nitrite &amp; ammonia</font></li>

</ul>

<span class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following should be measured on a less frequently say on a monthly

basis:

</font>
</span>
<ul class="style5">

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

metals such as As, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cu and any other that may be considered

relevant</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The daily flow into and out of the wetland should be monitored or modeled.</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Twenty four hour monitoring with a sampling frequency of at least every

4 hours should be completed at least every 3 months.</font></li>

</ul>

<span class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of the above analyses should be done to gain a fuller understanding

of the diurnal nature of the wetland.

<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.5.1.2 chemical monitoring of wetland health</b>
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wetland will gradually change its character over the years. Some
      
of the changes will be beneficial, such as a reduction in seepage. In general,
      
the wetland will become more mature with a more stable ecosystem. How this
      
will affect the function of the wetland as a filter is unknown. The knowledge
      
of wetlands is still very basic and any information that will help the
      
design of future wetlands both locally and internationally should be documented.
      
For these reasons the sampling locations need to be more extensive than
      
just at the inlet and outlet. The actual locations can only be chosen after
      
the design has been reviewed but a sample should be taken at the major
      
chemical and biological interfaces within the system.
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.5.1.2.1 parameters</b>
      
</font>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The parameters measured for the wetland effectiveness should duplicate
      
the samples taken for monitoring the wetland health plus the following:
</font>
<ul class="style5">

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Dissolved oxygen</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

pH</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

alinity/conductivity</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

alkalinity</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The redox potential of the sediment in several select locations should

be monitored weekly.</font></li>

</ul>

<span class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.5.2 biological monitoring</b>

</font></span>
<p class="style5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nature of the flow through the wetland is as important in monitoring
      
the biology as it was for the chemistry. Some of the biological changes
      
can be inferred from the chemical changes in parameters such as the nutrient
      
concentrations. However, it is still important to monitor species’ population
      
dynamics and distribution through the serial flow of the wetlands. Typical
      
monitoring should include: </font>
<ul class="style5">

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The emergent plants, which need to be mapped seasonally to highlight changes

within the biology.</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Planktonic plants and animals, which should be monitored weekly. The animals

may be sampled using a dip net but microscopic examination of water for

algae and blue-green bacteria is wise.</font></li>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Biological oxygen demand is needed as a useful indication of biological

activity</font></li>
